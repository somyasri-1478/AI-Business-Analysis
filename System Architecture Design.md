# System Architecture Design

## Overview
The system will be a full-stack web application designed to manage business operations using Google Sheets as the primary data backend, enhanced with AI capabilities and automation via Google Apps Script.

## Components

### 1. Frontend (React Application)
- **Purpose:** User interface for task management, delegation tracking, KPI dashboards, and reporting.
- **Technologies:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Key Features:**
    - Display and manage tasks (create, update, view).
    - View and update delegation status.
    - Visualize KPI data through interactive dashboards.
    - Generate and view reports.
    - User authentication and authorization (handled by backend).

### 2. Backend (Flask API)
- **Purpose:** Serve as the central hub for data exchange between the frontend, Google Sheets, and AI services. Handle business logic, authentication, and API integrations.
- **Technologies:** Python, Flask.
- **Key Features:**
    - RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication.
    - Google Sheets API integration for reading/writing data.
    - AI service integration (e.g., for task categorization, performance analysis).
    - User authentication and authorization.
    - Data validation and processing.

### 3. Google Sheets (Data Backend)
- **Purpose:** Store all operational data, including tasks, delegation records, and KPI metrics.
- **Key Sheets:**
    - **Master Task Sheet:** Task Name, Assigned To, Due Date, Priority, Status, Frequency, Completion Timestamp.
    - **Delegation Tracker:** Task Delegated, Person Responsible, Deadline, Status, Feedback/Comments.
    - **KPI Dashboards (Individual & Departmental):** Pre-defined KPIs, Monthly Targets vs Achievements, Status.
- **Features:**
    - Data validation rules.
    - Conditional formatting for status indicators (Red/Yellow/Green).

### 4. Google Apps Script (Automation Layer)
- **Purpose:** Automate recurring tasks, send notifications, generate reports, and sync data directly within the Google Sheets environment.
- **Key Functions:**
    - Auto-generate recurring tasks.
    - Send email/Slack/WhatsApp notifications for due/overdue tasks.
    - Auto-update workload dashboards.
    - Generate and email weekly/monthly performance summaries/reports.
    - Sync data between different sheets.

### 5. AI Services
- **Purpose:** Provide intelligent capabilities for task management, delegation, and performance analysis.
- **Key AI Integrations:**
    - **Task Categorization & Deadline Suggestion:** Analyze task descriptions and historical data to categorize priority/urgency and suggest deadlines.
    - **Workload Distribution:** Analyze team performance and current workload to recommend optimal task delegation.
    - **Performance Prediction:** Predict trends and potential performance dips based on historical KPI data.
    - **Summary & Insight Generation:** Generate natural language summaries and insights from dashboard data (e.g., performance bottlenecks, trends).
- **Technologies:** Python libraries for AI/ML (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas), potentially cloud-based AI APIs (e.g., Google Cloud AI Platform, if needed for advanced models).

## Data Flow
1. **Frontend to Backend:** User actions (e.g., creating a task, updating status) are sent as API requests to the Flask backend.
2. **Backend to Google Sheets:** The Flask backend interacts with the Google Sheets API to read, write, and update data based on frontend requests.
3. **Google Sheets to Google Apps Script:** Trigger-based automations in Google Apps Script run directly within Google Sheets (e.g., on form submission, time-driven triggers).
4. **Backend to AI Services:** The Flask backend sends relevant data to AI services for analysis and receives insights/predictions.
5. **AI Services to Backend:** AI services return processed data or insights to the Flask backend.
6. **Google Apps Script to External Services:** Google Apps Script can send notifications (email, Slack, WhatsApp) or trigger external integrations (Zapier/Make).
7. **Google Sheets to Google Data Studio:** Google Data Studio connects directly to Google Sheets for real-time dashboard visualization.

## Access Control & Versioning
- **Access Control:** Role-based access will be implemented at the Google Sheets level (sharing permissions) and potentially within the Flask backend for API access control.
- **Versioning:** Google Sheets' built-in version history will be utilized. A backup system for weekly snapshots will be implemented via Google Apps Script or a scheduled backend task.

## Next Steps
- Define detailed data models for each Google Sheet.
- Identify specific Google Sheets API functionalities required.
- Research and select appropriate AI libraries/APIs.




## Necessary APIs and Libraries

### Backend (Flask)
- **Google Sheets API Client Library for Python:** To interact with Google Sheets for reading, writing, and updating data. This will require setting up Google Cloud Project, enabling Google Sheets API, and creating service account credentials.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **Flask-CORS:** To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend communication.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preparation before feeding to AI models or for reporting.
- **Scikit-learn (or similar ML library):** For AI functionalities like task categorization, deadline suggestion, and performance prediction. This will be used for training and deploying simple models.

### Google Apps Script
- Built-in Google Apps Script services for:
    - **SpreadsheetApp:** To interact with Google Sheets.
    - **MailApp / GmailApp:** For sending email notifications.
    - **UrlFetchApp:** For making HTTP requests to external services (e.g., Slack/WhatsApp APIs, or even our own Flask backend for AI services if needed).
    - **PropertiesService:** For storing script properties (e.g., API keys).
    - **Triggers:** Time-driven triggers for recurring tasks and form submission triggers for KPI updates.

### Frontend (React)
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios (or Fetch API):** For making HTTP requests to the Flask backend.
- **Chart.js / Recharts (or similar charting library):** For visualizing KPI data and other metrics.
