## Phase 1: Project analysis and architecture design
- [x] Detailed breakdown of all requirements
- [x] Design overall system architecture (frontend, backend, Google Sheets, AI, Google Apps Script)
- [x] Identify necessary APIs and libraries
- [x] Plan data models for Google Sheets




### Detailed Breakdown of Requirements:

**1. Task Automation System:**
- Master Task Sheet in Google Sheets with columns: Task Name, Assigned To, Due Date, Priority, Status, Frequency (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), Completion Timestamp.
- Automate recurring tasks using Google Apps Script.
- Email/Slack/WhatsApp notifications for due/overdue tasks.
- AI Integration: Auto-categorize tasks (priority/urgency), suggest deadlines based on past trends.

**2. Delegation & Ownership System:**
- Delegation Tracker in Google Sheets with columns: Task Delegated, Person Responsible, Deadline, Status (Pending/In Progress/Complete), Feedback/Comments.
- Auto-updated dashboards for team workload and status.
- AI Integration: Analyze team performance, recommend optimal workload distribution.

**3. KPI-Based Performance Measurement System:**
- Individual & departmental KPI dashboards in Google Sheets.
- Pre-defined KPIs per role, Monthly Targets vs Achievements, Status (Red/Yellow/Green).
- Data validation for clean data input.
- Connect with Google Forms/data input sheets for auto-update.
- AI Integration: Predict trends/employee performance dips, generate weekly/monthly performance summaries.

**4. Dashboards & Reporting:**
- Real-time dashboards using Google Data Studio (connected to Sheets) or dynamic Sheets dashboards.
- Filters (team member, department, date range).
- Automated weekly/monthly reports emailed to management.
- AI Integration: AI-generated summaries & insights (performance bottlenecks, trends, inventory alerts).

**5. Automation Infrastructure:**
- Google Apps Script for task creation, reminders, report generation.
- Sync data between multiple sheets.
- Optional: Integrate with Zapier/Make for other platforms (CRM, Email, Slack, WhatsApp).

**6. Access Control & Versioning:**
- Role-based access control for sheets and dashboards.
- Version logs for each update/KPI entry.
- Backup system for weekly snapshots.
